# Creating the plots

I switched to R For further processing of the data (including clustering) and creating the final roster visualizations. Full code is available in `create_plots.Rmd`. Processing of the data involved:

* adding the cost for each player and inducement (yes, I typed together a file with the cost of all the BB2020 rosters!), 
* creating a table with all the skill colors, 
* removing the bribes from the inducements that originated from the "Get the ref" kickoff event (but keeping those that are part of the roster)
* applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm (`hclust_order()` from my own wrapper package `ggoheatmap`) to create a sort order for the rosters.

I used `ggplot` create the final plots. For ease of sharing, I created `roster_book.Rmd` that generates a PDF that contains all 29 plots.

There are also rosters with Norse Catcher AND Norse Raider. (old/new) march 2022, roster id 5144. This roster contains

# condense skill stacking rows

A player with two skills has two rows, collapse into one, concatenating the two skills.
We sort by skill_id to avoid mirror combinations.

```{r}

# wrangle bribes into cnt 0-3 bribes

```

```{r}

  select(-n)
```

# Produce stats on the number of skills in the teams assessed and check missing color in the color table

The skill_colors.ods should then be checked manually for any NA (or empty) in the color column. The rows concerned should be added to 230218 bb_skill_colors.ods

```{r}
skill_stats_and_missing_colors <- df_rosters %>%

manually fill in cost and sort order

# add codelist with roster cost

```

# remove bribes for TV >1150


all teams with 50 or 100 extra, remove 1 bribe ("get the ref" kick off result ends up on the match page)

```{r}
teams_get_the_ref <- res %>%
  filter(team_cost > 1150) %>%
  ungroup() %>%

```

reduce nr of bribes for get the ref teams with 1

<!-- So there are 22 get the ref teams -->

```{r}
df_rosters %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(position == "1 bribe") %>%
  summarise(sum(cnt))

<!-- expect 45 - 22 = 23 bribes left -->

```


```{r}

check!

drop rows with cnt 0

```{r}
df_rosters <- df_rosters %>% 
  filter(cnt != 0)
```


# Check total team cost again

Expect all teams at max 1150 or slightly below.

```{r}
